## üì¶ Projects Overview

### 1. Temperature & Humidity Monitoring with Fan Control

An intelligent environmental monitoring system that:

- Reads room temperature and humidity using a **DHT22** sensor.
- Sends the data to a remote cloud platform for live monitoring.
- Receives user-defined thresholds from the platform to control a **fan**.
- Displays real-time readings on an **OLED screen**.

**üí° Use Case:** Ideal for smart homes, greenhouses, classrooms, or office environments requiring automated temperature regulation.

### 2. SmartLights Control System

A smart lighting solution that:

- Toggles an **LED** ON or OFF based on commands from a web platform.
- Supports blinking functionality based on user-defined intervals.
- Allows scheduling of LED operations through platform-based timers.

**üí° Use Case:** Home and office lighting systems that benefit from automation, remote control, or timed operation.
